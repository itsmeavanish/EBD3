BRAND ACCESS PORTAL GUIDE
=========================

URL: /brand-access

This is a public portal where brands can view their orders without needing to create an account.

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
Brands are provided with credentials consisting of:
1. Brand Name (exact as stored in orders)
2. Access Key (generated automatically)

ACCESS KEY FORMAT:
------------------
The access key is generated using this pattern:
{brandname_lowercase_no_spaces}_2024

Examples:
- Brand Name: "Nike" → Access Key: "nike_2024"
- Brand Name: "Adidas" → Access Key: "adidas_2024"
- Brand Name: "Puma India" → Access Key: "pumaindia_2024"
- Brand Name: "H&M" → Access Key: "h&m_2024"
